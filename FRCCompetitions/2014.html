<h2>FIRST Robotics Competition 2014: (AERIAL ASSIST)</h2>
<p> Two alliances of three teams each compete in a race against time of two minutes and 30 seconds and against each other to score as many points by having the robot throw a ball into one of their goals. The ball shots can be blocked by a “goalie” robot in order to prevent the other team from scoring.<p>
