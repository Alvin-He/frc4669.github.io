      <p>Galileo Robotics is an FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team headquartered at the Galileo Academy of Science and Technology,
        a public high school in San Francisco, California.
        We’re a team of around 30 high school students from varying tech backgrounds.
        Founded in 2013 by Galileo’s students and computer science teachers,
        we seek to create a welcoming school environment that will inspire future generations of students into the tech industry.</p>

        <h4 class="featurette-heading">What do we do?</h4>
        <p>Galileo Robotics competes in the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition, or FRC for short. With our various sub-teams within a team, we learn to work together and apply real-life concepts towards creating our robot. Every sub-team has its own role, including CADing, marketing, and building the robot as a whole, just to name a few. Each member has their own role within the club, where they perform certain duties to help contribute the construction of the robot. The robotics club is beyond only performing duties, it’s a learning experience where our members can learn a variety of useful skills for life.</p>

			<h4 class="featurette-heading">What is FIRST Robotics?</h4>
			<p>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) is a non-profit organization that was started in 1989 in a high school gym. It has inspired students to choose careers in Science and Technology and now reaches over 100,000 students worldwide.
			<br>Our club is different compared to most after-school extracurriculars. We work as a team in creating a robot that can compete in the FIRST competition while learning and refining skills that can be used in the outside world, like coding, computer-aided design, and basic physics. The officers in our club have the sole duty to mentor our new members to continue future of the  Galileo Robotics team.
			Through our many differences and hardships, we are capable of working together, as a team, to accomplish the goal of building a robot for the FIRST competition.</p>

        <h4 class="featurette-heading">SUBTEAMS</h4>
        <p>Members can participate in various subteams. The subteams consist of Programming, Marketing, Management, C.A.D., Robot Build, Field Build, Electrical, and Safety/Equipment.
		<br>
        Software: The software team is responsible for coding the robot to do its functions as needed.
        <br>Marketing: The marketing team designs the club’s flyers, banners, and posters. 
        <br>Management: The management team takes attendance, gets supplies for the construction of the robot, and performs odd jobs at the discretion of our sponsor and captain. 
        <br>C.A.D. : The C.A.D. team creates computer-aided designs, of different and varying parts that go on the robot and the field build team.
        <br>Robot Build: The Robot Build team helps to assemble parts of the robot that perform functions based on our competition, like a tank drive or ball shooter.
        <br>Field Build: The Field Build team builds different structures depending on the competition-for instance, they would build a goal in which we need to shoot balls, in the case of the 2017 FIRST Steamworks competition.
        <br>Electrical: The Electrical team deals with wirings for the robot and all electrical-related parts. 
        <br>Safety: The Safety team prioritizes the safety of fellow members during the construction of the robot and its parts. </p>
